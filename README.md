- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Maximum and Minimum Element from Array
- Matrix Multiplication Chain
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm

### Branch and Bound
- 15 Puzzle Problem

### Backtracking
- 8-Queens Problem
- Graph Coloring (Hamiltonian)

### Greedy Method
- Knapsack Problem
- Job Sequencing with Deadlines
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm

### Graph Traversal
